Terrain design

We wanted the terrain tu be fun to play. We also wanted that the terrain would not be old and boring after a few games.
For this the terrain need to have enought wariety so that the it can be played with many different strategies. 
The other main criteria for the terrain was that the game has to work well with it. The enemies can't get stuck in it and the player and enemies can't get out from the area
We wanted it also fit ouer design so the terrain needed to be dry and deserted.

The terrain is now a deserted valley surounded by mountains on every side. The terrain has signs of beeing somethime a green walley with its 
dry waterfall and river and the dead trees. There is also ruins of a old city and a castle that has been taken by the orcs. 
The playes is engouraged to explore the area because it has additional guns and an armor somewhere. The fact that we desided that the player can pick upp the treasure after dropping it
makes it possible to explore even better.
