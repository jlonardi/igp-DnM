- protect the treasure

--------------
- you don't have to slay the dragon if you're not up for it, the game can still be finished
- there are items on the map which may help your fight with the enemies
- don't lose focus on the treasure as total treasure value will affect the final score

Start & Settings
----------------
Start the game by running DnM.exe. This will start the configurator where you can
change the graphics settings and alter the default keymapping.

If your computer can handle it, always run the game with "Fantastic" quality setting as this will make sure you have
the best shadowing and antialiasing settings enabled. "Normal" will give a compromise with simpler shadows and 
"Fastest" will disable all shadowing and antialiasing so the game can run on slower computers.

When everything is set, hit Play!-button and have fun!
