Start & Settings
----------------
Start the game by running DnM.exe. This will start the configurator where you can
change the graphics settings and alter the default keymapping.

If your computer can handle it, always run the game with "Fantastic" quality setting as this will make sure you have
the best shadowing and antialiashing settings enabled. "Normal" will give a compromise with simpler shadows and 
"Fastest" will disable all shadowing and antialiashing so game can run on slower computers.

When everything is set, hit Play!-button and have fun!
