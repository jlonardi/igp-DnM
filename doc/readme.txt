Menus
-----
- you can load your previous game progress from Main Menu or Pause Menu
- game progress can be saved at any time by pausing the game and selecting Save Game
- please note that you will lose any unsaved progress by going into main menu as there is no autosaving!


Start & Settings
----------------
Start the game by running DnM.exe. This will start the configurator where you can
change the graphics settings and alter the default keymapping.

If your computer can handle it, always run the game with "Fantastic" quality setting as this will 
make sure you have the best shadowing and antialiasing settings enabled.  "Normal" will give a 
compromise with simpler shadows and "Fastest" will disable all shadowing and antialiasing so the 
game can run on slower computers.

When everything is set, hit Play!-button and have fun!
